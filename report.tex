\title{Impact of Social Media Sentiment on Cryptocurrency Price Movements: \\
A Deep Learning Approach}
\author{[Bal Acharya]}
\date{\today}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    This research presents a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between social media sentiment and cryptocurrency price movements, focusing on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). We implement state-of-the-art natural language processing models, specifically BERT and RoBERTa, alongside traditional LSTM models for sentiment analysis of social media posts. Our study develops and deploys a sophisticated data pipeline that processes real-time and historical social media data, performing sentiment analysis and correlating it with cryptocurrency price movements.

    The research findings demonstrate significant correlations between social media
    sentiment and cryptocurrency price movements, with correlation coefficients of
    0.31 and 0.35 for BTC and ETH respectively in short-term analysis, and 0.42 and
    0.45 in medium-term analysis. Our implementation of RoBERTa achieved superior
    performance with 87\% accuracy in sentiment classification, compared to BERT's
    85\% accuracy. The study also reveals that sentiment indicators can serve as
    leading indicators for price movements, particularly during high volatility
    periods, with a demonstrated lag effect between sentiment changes and price
    movements.

    This research contributes to the growing field of cryptocurrency market
    analysis by providing empirical evidence of sentiment-price relationships and
    introducing a robust methodology for real-time sentiment analysis in
    cryptocurrency markets. The findings have significant implications for traders,
    researchers, and market analysts in developing predictive models and trading
    strategies.

\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Background}
The cryptocurrency market, characterized by its high volatility and sensitivity
to public sentiment, presents unique challenges and opportunities for market
analysis. Unlike traditional financial markets, cryptocurrency markets operate
24/7 and are heavily influenced by social media discourse and public sentiment.
This research aims to quantify these relationships using advanced machine
learning techniques. The advent of social media platforms like Twitter has
provided a rich source of data that reflects public sentiment in real-time,
making it a valuable tool for market analysis.

\section{Research Objectives}
The primary objectives of this research are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item To develop a robust pipeline for collecting and analyzing
          cryptocurrency-related social media sentiment
    \item To evaluate the effectiveness of different transformer-based models in
          sentiment analysis
    \item To investigate the correlation between social media sentiment and
          cryptocurrency price movements
    \item To assess the potential of sentiment analysis as a predictive tool for
          cryptocurrency price movements
\end{itemize}

\section{Significance}
Understanding the relationship between social media sentiment and
cryptocurrency prices is crucial for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Market participants making informed investment decisions
    \item Researchers studying market psychology and behavior
    \item Developers building trading algorithms and market analysis tools
\end{itemize}
This study contributes to the growing body of literature on the intersection of social media analytics and financial markets, providing insights that could enhance trading strategies and risk management.

\chapter{Literature Review}
\section{Sentiment Analysis in Financial Markets}
Previous research has shown strong correlations between public sentiment and
market movements in traditional financial markets. Studies by Bollen et al.
(2011) demonstrated that Twitter mood could predict stock market changes with
87.6\% accuracy. Other studies have explored the use of sentiment analysis in
predicting market trends, highlighting the potential of social media as a
predictive tool.

\section{Cryptocurrency Market Characteristics}
Cryptocurrency markets differ from traditional markets in several key aspects:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 24/7 trading
    \item Global accessibility
    \item High volatility
    \item Strong influence of social media
    \item Regulatory uncertainty
\end{itemize}
These characteristics make cryptocurrencies particularly susceptible to sentiment-driven price movements, necessitating the use of advanced analytical techniques.

\section{Transformer Models in NLP}
Recent advances in transformer models have revolutionized NLP tasks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Self-attention mechanisms
    \item Contextual embeddings
    \item Pre-training on large datasets
    \item Fine-tuning capabilities
\end{itemize}
Transformers, such as BERT and RoBERTa, have set new benchmarks in sentiment analysis, offering improved accuracy and efficiency over traditional models. This study leverages these models to analyze social media sentiment related to cryptocurrencies.

\chapter{Methodology}
\section{System Architecture}
The system architecture consists of three main components:
